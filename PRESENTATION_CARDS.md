Essential JS/TS Utility Packages

A set of utility packages I found myself recreating in almost every new JavaScript project. Now, they’re open source and ready for you to use—independently or together.
---
Why These Packages?

- Bring proven patterns from C#, Laravel, React Query, and more to JavaScript/TypeScript
- Unified, modular, and flexible tools
- Focus on business logic, not plumbing
---
PorkAte (pronounced "Pocket")

- Foundation utilities for scalable apps
- Shared interfaces and helpers
- Use as a base or standalone
---
Payments Made Easy: porkate/payment

- Plug-and-play payment gateway manager
- Integrate multiple gateways with minimal setup
- Use only if you need payments—no extra baggage
---
Smart Caching & Invalidation: Invalid8 (pronounced "Invalidate")

- Inspired by React Query
- Advanced caching and invalidation framework
- Use the full package or just the cache/event modules
---
invalid8/cache & invalid8/event

- **invalid8/cache**: Standalone caching layer
- **invalid8/event**: Event-driven invalidation, works with any adapter
- Mix and match as needed, or use only what you need
---
Storage, Simplified: Kolo (Yoruba for "save/storage")

- Storage adapter for S3, Cloudinary, Azure, local, and more
- Unified interface for all storage providers
- Use only what you need, no bloat
---
Notifications, Reimagined: TownKrier (pronounced "town crier")

- Inspired by Laravel notifications
- Flexible notification and messaging system
- Send notifications via multiple channels easily
---
Plug & Play, No Lock-In

- Use any package independently—install only what you need
- Switch services/providers anytime
- No vendor lock-in, ever
---
Why Get Excited?

- Focus on your business logic
- Modular, scalable, and future-proof
- Open source: [github.com/jeremiah-olisa/PorkAte](https://github.com/jeremiah-olisa/PorkAte/)

If you only need a payment gateway, install the gateway package. If you need just caching, install the caching package. Want invalidation with caching? Use the full Invalid8 with any adapter. Same for Kolo and TownKrier—standalone or together, your choice.
