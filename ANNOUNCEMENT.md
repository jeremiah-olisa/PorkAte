# ðŸš€ Hey JS/TS Developers! 


For the rest of the year, I'm building a suite of packages to make your life easier and your codebase cleaner. 

**Inspirations:**
- Unified interfaces from C# (Microsoft)
- Robust notification system from Laravel
- React Query for smart caching and invalidation

Why not bring these proven patterns to the JavaScript ecosystem?

## Introducing: PorkAte Ecosystem

- **porkate**: The core foundation for all packages.
- **porkate/payment**: Plug-and-play payment gateway manager. Need payments? Just install this.
- **invalid8**: Smart invalidation and caching framework, inspired by React Query.
  - **invalid8/cache**: Use only the caching layer if that's all you need.
  - **invalid8/event**: Event-driven invalidation, works with any adapter.
- **kolo**: Storage adapter with providers like S3, Cloudinary, Azure, and local storage.
- **townkrier**: Flexible notification and messaging system, inspired by Laravel notifications.

## Why should you be excited?
- **Focus on your business logic** â€“ let the packages handle the plumbing.
- **Plug and play** â€“ use only what you need, nothing more.
- **No vendor lock-in** â€“ switch services and adapters anytime.

Whether you need just a payment gateway, a caching solution, or a full notification system, you can install only what you need. Mix and match, or go all in!
