THE AUTHENTICATION SHOULD BE Limited to wallet authentication and authorization not login logot email password like authentication the users of the app would create their own authentication or use clerk

also there would be no ned for application level authentication since its a package and not a saas



Update the setup script to be a mono repo

also my problem with prisma is that the user would have to change the schema  in the codebase to change the db provider

is there a way i can work around that so if i want use msql, mysql, ... i would be able to do that and you can use zenstack http://zenstack.dev/

and use lerna to setup the mono repo
i want the adapters to be able to standalone as a different package
