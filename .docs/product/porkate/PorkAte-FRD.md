# Functional Requirements Document: PorkAte Wallet Package

**Version:** 2.0  
**Date:** October 23, 2025  
**Package Name:** PorkAte (pronounced "Pocket")  
**Author:** Jeremiah Olisa  
**Type:** Open Source Package

---

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the functional requirements for **PorkAte**, an open-source wallet package designed to provide secure, reliable, and compliant digital wallet functionalities. PorkAte serves as a plug-and-play solution for building financial applications such as core banking systems, loan management platforms, savings applications, and payment solutions.

**Vision:** To eliminate the need for CTOs and CFOs to build wallet systems from scratch by providing an industry-standard, production-ready package that adheres to financial accounting principles, including double-entry bookkeeping, with robust security measures and flexible integration options.

---

## 2. Package Philosophy & Architecture

### 2.1 Core Principles

- **Provider Agnostic:** PorkAte is not tied to any specific third-party service or API. Users have complete flexibility in choosing their technology stack.
- **Plug-and-Play:** Minimal configuration required to get started, with sensible defaults.
- **Industry Standards:** Follows financial regulations (CBN guidelines, PCI-DSS compliance principles) and accounting best practices.
- **Extensible:** Easy to create custom adapters/providers when official support doesn't exist.
- **Production Ready:** Built with enterprise-grade security, performance, and reliability in mind.
- **Authentication Neutral:** PorkAte does NOT handle user authentication (login/logout/registration/password management). It focuses solely on wallet operations. Applications integrate with their preferred authentication providers (Clerk, Auth0, Firebase, NextAuth, etc.).

### 2.2 Adapter/Provider Architecture

PorkAte uses a flexible adapter pattern for all external dependencies:

- **Database Adapter:** Prisma (supports PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, SQL Server, SQLite, CockroachDB)
- **NoSQL Adapter:** Repository pattern for transaction storage (Cassandra, MongoDB, DynamoDB, etc.)
- **Caching Adapter:** Redis, In-Memory, or custom implementations
- **Event Adapter:** Event-driven architecture support (RabbitMQ, Kafka, AWS SNS/SQS, etc.)
- **Payment Gateway Adapter:** Paystack, Flutterwave, Stripe, or custom providers
- **Notification Adapter:** SMS, Email, Push notifications
- **Storage Adapter:** For KYC documents (AWS S3, Azure Blob, local filesystem, etc.)

**Note:** User authentication/authorization is handled by the consuming application using their chosen provider. PorkAte provides wallet-level transaction authorization (PIN, biometric, OTP) only.

Users can easily extend any adapter by implementing the corresponding interface.

---

## 3. Scope

The PorkAte package encompasses:

- Wallet creation and management
- Multi-tier KYC management (Individual, Group, Corporate)
- Secure authentication and authorization
- Balance inquiry and management
- Fund transfers (debit/credit operations)
- Transaction history tracking with efficient querying
- Wallet lien management
- Transaction reversal and reconciliation
- Multi-currency and multi-language support

### 4.3. Wallet Transaction Authorization

**IMPORTANT:** PorkAte is a **library/package**, NOT a SaaS service, therefore:
- **NO application-level authentication (API keys)** is needed
- **NO user authentication (login/logout/email/password/sessions)** is provided

User identity management is the responsibility of the consuming application. Applications should use their own authentication systems (e.g., Clerk, Auth0, Firebase Auth, NextAuth, or custom solutions).

PorkAte focuses solely on **wallet transaction authorization** for financial operations.

- **FR-WA-001: Wallet Transaction Authorization:**

  - For sensitive wallet operations (debit transactions, transfers, wallet modifications), the package SHALL require transaction-level authorization.
  - Supported authorization methods SHALL include:
    - PIN (Personal Identification Number) - hashed using bcrypt/argon2
    - Biometric verification (Face ID, Fingerprint) through device attestation
    - Pattern Recognition
    - OTP (One-Time Password) via configured notification adapter
  - Authorization credentials SHALL be stored securely using industry-standard hashing algorithms.
  - **Note:** These methods authorize wallet operations, not user login.

- **FR-WA-002: Transaction Authorization Flow:**

  - All sensitive wallet operations SHALL require authorization before execution.
  - The package SHALL validate authorization credentials (PIN, biometric, OTP) before processing transactions.
  - Failed authorization attempts SHALL be logged and rate-limited (e.g., max 3 PIN attempts per wallet).
  - The package SHALL support configurable authorization retry policies.
  - Authorization is wallet-scoped, not session-based.

- **FR-WA-003: User Identity Integration:**
  - The package SHALL NOT handle user registration, login, logout, password management, or session management.
  - The consuming application SHALL manage user identities and sessions using their preferred authentication provider.
  - The package SHALL accept a `userId` or `externalUserId` parameter to link wallets to application users.
  - User identity verification SHALL be the responsibility of the consuming application before calling wallet operations.
  - The package SHALL trust the calling application to provide valid userId after authenticating the user.
  - **Trust Model:** Application handles user authentication; PorkAte handles wallet transaction authorization.
  - **Example Integration:** Application authenticates user via Clerk → Application verifies user identity → Application calls PorkAte with userId → User authorizes transaction with PIN/biometric.

    ],
    // ... group and corporate tiers
  },
});

await wallet.initialize();
```

### 9.2. Creating a Wallet

```typescript
const newWallet = await wallet.wallets.create({
  phoneNumber: "+2348012345678",
  accountType: "individual",
  currency: "NGN",
  status: "active",
});

console.log("Wallet created:", newWallet.accountNumber);
```

### 9.3. Creating KYC Profile

```typescript
const kyc = await wallet.kyc.create({
  walletId: newWallet.id,
  profileType: "individual",
  data: {

    phoneNumber: "+2348012345678",
    email: "john.doe@example.com",
    dateOfBirth: "1990-01-01",
  },
  tier: 1,
});
```

### 9.4. Performing a Transfer

```typescript
// NOTE: User has already been authenticated by the application (e.g., via Clerk, Auth0, etc.)
// Application passes userId to PorkAte after authenticating the user

// User authorizes the transaction with PIN
const authResult = await wallet.auth.verifyPIN({
  walletId: newWallet.id,
  pin: "1234",
});

if (authResult.success) {
  const transfer = await wallet.transactions.transfer({
    fromWalletId: newWallet.id,
    toAccountNumber: "0123456789", // or use toPhoneNumber
    amount: 5000,
    narration: "Payment for services",
    currency: "NGN",
    // authentication is handled internally after verifyPIN
  });

  console.log("Transfer successful:", transfer.reference);
}
```

### 9.5. Checking Balance

```typescript
const balance = await wallet.wallets.getBalance(newWallet.id);

console.log("Total Balance:", balance.total);
console.log("Available Balance:", balance.available);
console.log("Active Liens:", balance.liens);
```

### 9.6. Placing and Releasing Liens

// Place a lien (e.g., for loan collateral)
const lien = await wallet.liens.place({
  walletId: newWallet.id,
  amount: 10000,
  reason: "Loan collateral",
  reference: "LOAN-12345",
  expiryDate: new Date("2025-12-31"),
});

// Release the lien later
await wallet.liens.release(lien.id);
```

### 9.7. Querying Transaction History

```typescript
const history = await wallet.transactions.getHistory({
  walletId: newWallet.id,
  startDate: "2025-01-01",
  endDate: "2025-10-23",
  limit: 50,
  cursor: null, // For pagination
  filters: {
    status: "SUCCESS",
    type: "DEBIT",
  },
});

console.log("Transactions:", history.items);
console.log("Next cursor:", history.nextCursor);
```

### 9.8. Handling Events

```typescript
// Subscribe to wallet events
wallet.events.subscribe("wallet.transaction.completed", async (event) => {
  console.log("Transaction completed:", event.data);

  // Send notification to user
  await sendNotification(event.data.walletId, "Transaction completed");
});

wallet.events.subscribe("wallet.security.hashMismatch", async (event) => {
  console.error("Security alert:", event.data);

  // Notify admins
  await alertAdmins(event.data);
});
```

    walletId: string,
    options: QueryOptions
  ): Promise<Transaction[]> {
    // Custom implementation
  }

  // ... implement other required methods
}
