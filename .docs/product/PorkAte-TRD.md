**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** October 23, 2025  
**Package Name:** PorkAte  
**Author:** Jeremiah Olisa  
**Type:** Open Source Package

---

## 1. Introduction

This TRD defines the technical implementation details for the PorkAte wallet package, translating functional requirements into concrete architecture, technology choices, data models, interfaces, and integration strategies. It is intended for developers and architects responsible for building, maintaining, and extending the package.

---

## 2. Architecture Overview

- **Monorepo Structure:** Organized by adapters, core, examples, and documentation.
- **Adapter Pattern:** All external dependencies (DB, cache, events, payment, etc.) are abstracted via interfaces and pluggable adapters.
- **Provider Agnostic:** No hard dependencies on any third-party service; all integrations are via adapters.
- **TypeScript:** All code is written in TypeScript for type safety and maintainability.
- **Async Operations:** All public APIs return Promises; async/await is used throughout.
- **Configuration-Driven:** Initialization via a comprehensive config object; supports environment overrides.

---

## 3. Technology Stack

- **Language:** TypeScript (Node.js >= 18)
- **ORM:** Prisma (PostgreSQL recommended, supports MySQL, SQLite, SQL Server, CockroachDB)
- **NoSQL:** Cassandra (reference), MongoDB, DynamoDB, or custom via adapter
- **Cache:** Redis (reference), In-Memory, Memcached, or custom via adapter
- **Event System:** RabbitMQ (reference), Kafka, SNS/SQS, Service Bus, In-Memory
- **Payment Gateways:** Paystack, Flutterwave, Stripe (reference implementations)
- **Testing:** Jest (unit/integration), custom mocks for adapters
- **Containerization:** Docker, Docker Compose, Kubernetes manifests
- **Observability:** Prometheus metrics, OpenTelemetry tracing

---

## 4. Core Modules & Interfaces

### 4.1. Configuration
- `PorkAteConfig` interface defines all configuration options (see FRD section 8).
- Validation at startup; errors are thrown for misconfigurations.
- Environment variable support via dotenv.

### 4.2. Adapters
- **Database Adapter:** PrismaClient, schema files, migrations.
- **NoSQL Adapter:** Interface for transaction storage; Cassandra reference implementation.
- **Cache Adapter:** Interface for caching; Redis reference implementation.
- **Event Adapter:** Interface for event publishing/subscription; RabbitMQ reference implementation.
- **Payment Gateway Adapter:** Interface for payment operations; Paystack/Flutterwave/Stripe reference implementations.
- **Notification Adapter:** Interface for SMS/Email/Push; pluggable.
- **Storage Adapter:** Interface for KYC document storage; S3, Azure Blob, local filesystem.

### 4.3. Core Classes
- `PorkAte`: Main entry point; exposes wallet, KYC, transaction, lien, event, and utility modules.
- `WalletManager`: Handles wallet CRUD, status, integrity checks.
- `KYCManager`: Handles KYC profiles, tier evaluation, document management.
- `TransactionManager`: Handles debit/credit, transfers, ledger, idempotency, reversal.
- `LienManager`: Handles lien placement, release, expiry.
- `EventManager`: Handles event emission and subscription.
- `AuthorizationManager`: Handles wallet transaction authorization (PIN, biometric, OTP) ONLY.
  - **Note:** Does NOT handle user authentication (login/logout/email/password). Applications use their own auth providers (Clerk, Auth0, Firebase, NextAuth, etc.).
  - **Note:** Does NOT handle application-level authentication (API keys). PorkAte is a library/package, not a SaaS service.

## 5. Data Models

- **Wallet:**
  - Fields: id (UUID), userId (external), accountNumber, phoneNumber, type, status, balance, currency, kycTier, pin (hashed), hash, timestamps
  - **Note:** userId links to external user management system (Clerk, Auth0, Firebase, NextAuth, etc.)
  - **Note:** PIN is for transaction authorization only, not user login
- **KYC Profile:**
  - Fields: id, walletId, profileType, tier, data (JSON), status, documents, timestamps
- **Transaction:**
  - Fields: id (UUID), reference, type, sourceWalletId, destinationWalletId, amount, currency, fees, status, narration, metadata, idempotencyKey, hash, timestamps
- **Lien:**
  - Fields: id (UUID), walletId, amount, reason, status, expiry, reference, timestamps
- **Ledger Entry:**
  - Fields: id, walletId, type (debit/credit), amount, previousBalance, currentBalance, transactionReference, timestamps
- **Event:**
  - Fields: id (UUID), type, timestamp, source, data, metadata

---

## 6. Security

- **Encryption:** AES-256-GCM for data at rest; TLS 1.3+ for data in transit (when deployed as API).
- **Hashing:** bcrypt/argon2 for wallet PINs; SHA-256/SHA-512 for wallet integrity.
- **User Authentication:** NOT handled by PorkAte. Applications use their own auth providers (Clerk, Auth0, Firebase, NextAuth, custom, etc.).
- **Transaction Authorization:** PIN/Biometric/OTP for wallet operations ONLY; wallet-scoped, not session-based.
- **Application Authentication:** NOT needed - PorkAte is a library/package, not a SaaS service with API keys.
- **Rate Limiting:** Optional; can be implemented by consuming application if needed.
- **Input Validation:** All inputs validated using class-validator or custom logic.
- **Audit Logging:** Immutable logs; stored in append-only format.
- **Trust Model:** PorkAte trusts the calling application to handle user identity verification. The application passes userId to PorkAte after authenticating the user.

## 7. Transaction Processing

- **Double-Entry Ledger:** Enforced via database schema and business logic.
- **Processing Models:**
  - Model A: Real-time balance update (row-level locking)
  - Model B: Deferred update (ledger reconciliation, incremental caching)
- **Idempotency:** Enforced via cache adapter; idempotency keys expire after configurable TTL.
- **Concurrency Control:**
  - Pessimistic locking for Model A
  - Optimistic/eventual consistency for Model B
- **Fee Calculation:** Configurable; handled as separate ledger entries.

---

## 8. KYC & Tier Management

- **Profile Types:** Individual, Group, Corporate; enforced via schema and validation.
- **Tier Structure:** Configurable; limits enforced before transactions.
- **Document Storage:** Encrypted; time-limited access URLs via storage adapter.
- **Verification Workflow:** Status transitions emit events; tier upgrades require verification.

---

## 9. API & SDK Design

- **Library Usage:** Main entry is `PorkAte` class/factory; all methods async.
- **RESTful Endpoints:** Optional; utilities provided for Express/NestJS integration.
- **Error Handling:** Custom error classes; error codes/messages/context/stack trace.
- **Type Definitions:** Comprehensive TypeScript types for all public APIs.

---

## 10. Testing & Quality Assurance

- **Unit Tests:** Jest; >80% coverage required for core modules.
- **Integration Tests:** Adapter implementations, migrations, end-to-end flows.
- **Performance Tests:** Load/stress/concurrency scenarios; 1,000 TPS target.
- **Security Tests:** Penetration, injection, authentication bypass.

---

## 11. Deployment & Operations

- **Docker:** Dockerfile and Compose for local/prod deployments.
- **Kubernetes:** Helm charts for scalable deployments.
- **Environment Variables:** All secrets/configs externalized; `.env.example` provided.
- **Migrations:** Prisma migration scripts; rollback supported.
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus metrics endpoint; health checks for orchestration.

---

## 12. Documentation & Community

- **Docs:** Getting started, API reference, architecture, integration, operations.
- **Contribution:** Guidelines, code of conduct, PR templates.
- **Support:** GitHub issues, Discord/Slack, Stack Overflow.
- **License:** MIT

---

## 13. Roadmap & Future Enhancements
